# ---------------------------------------------------------------- copy decks
# Every string below the hero used to be a single hardcoded constant, so 1000
# sites shipped the same words. Measured: below-hero text was 81% similar at the
# median and two sites were 100.0% identical after swapping the city name.
#
# These decks hold authored ALTERNATIVES for each slot, picked per-domain by
# digest (same mechanism as BUTTON_STYLES). Rules for anything added here:
#
#   * Variants must be factually INTERCHANGEABLE -- the same claims in different
#     words and order. They are re-phrasings, not new promises. A site cannot
#     back up a claim just because the deck made one.
#   * Do not assert social proof (review counts, ratings, testimonials). The
#     sites have none, and the original "Local crew, real reviews" trust item
#     was already overstating it -- the replacements below drop that claim.
#   * ORDER IS APPEND-ONLY. Selection is digest % len(deck), so reordering
#     re-rolls every domain. Add new variants at the end.
#
# "{city}" is substituted with the escaped city name at render time.

   so a fixed bar would just be a fifth CTA; below it, the top-bar phone link
   scrolls away and the burger is the only thing left.

   --callbar-h drives BOTH the bar height and the space reserved for it, so they
   cannot drift apart. The reservation goes on .gfooter, not body: body is white
   and .gfooter is #0e141b, so body padding would paint a white strip under the
   dark footer whenever the two numbers disagreed by even a pixel.

   z-index must stay BELOW header.site's 60. The header has a backdrop-filter and
   so forms a stacking context; the open mobile nav panel is its child and
   therefore paints above this bar and covers it, which is what we want. */

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- CTA styles
# Six button treatments, harvested from the four designs already in this repo so
# the vocabulary stays coherent: "solid" is the historical default, "glow" is
# nimbus's soft-shadow lift, "press" is volt's hard offset shadow, "edge" is
# ironclad's hairline uppercase outline; "raised" and "cut" fill the gaps.
#
# Each preset owns radius, padding, border weight, type treatment and the
# primary/outline fills, and renders against the site's own theme tokens -- so
# two sites sharing a preset but not a theme still don't look alike.
#
# Every preset MUST set transform and filter on :hover. The base rules at
# build_site.py:441-442 apply both `filter:brightness(1.06)` and
# `translateY(-1px)`; a preset that only redefines `background` inherits them.
#
# ORDER IS AN APPEND-ONLY CONTRACT. Selection is digest % len(BUTTON_STYLES), so
# inserting, removing or reordering a preset re-rolls the assignment for nearly
# all 1001 domains. Add new presets at the end only.

We're not a national call center routing your job to whoever's cheapest that day - the person who answers the phone is part of the same crew that shows up in your driveway.

Repairs cover the things that fail without warning - a snapped torsion spring, a frayed cable, a door jumped off its track, a bent panel, or an opener that hums but won't lift. Service is the preventive side - spring-tension checks, roller and hinge replacement, lubrication, and safety-sensor alignment that keep an aging door running quiet. Installation is for when a door is past saving and a new insulated one makes more sense than another round of patches."),

Those doors were built to a lighter spec than what's standard now, so the rollers, cables, and springs on them wear faster and tend to fail in predictable ways. Knowing the local housing stock means we can usually narrow down what's wrong before we're even in the driveway, and give you a straight answer on whether it's worth repairing or time to replace."),

You get a written quote before any work starts, and most repairs are handled the same or next day - broken springs and stuck doors don't wait, and neither do we."),
